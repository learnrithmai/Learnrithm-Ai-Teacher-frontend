Dear Shohruz Ernazarov,

I am writing to formally notify you that, effective immediately, your internship with Learnrithm Ltd as a Software Engineer Intern is hereby terminated.

Despite repeated attempts to reach you via Slack and other channels, you have remained non-responsive and have often provided answers to critical project-related questions late. This behavior constitutes a breach of your responsibilities under Section 2 of your signed Internship Agreement, which outlines your obligation to diligently and in good faith perform all assigned duties.

Additionally, please be reminded that you are bound by the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement as well as the Non-Complete Clause outlined in Section 4.3 of your agreement. You are strictly prohibited from using, sharing, or revealing any proprietary information, code, source code, or data of any nature. Any conduct that may result in a breach of these terms will be met with necessary legal action.

We urge you to return all hardware and software - either in person or via postal mail - to our office immediately upon receipt of this letter. Any delays or abnormalities will result in serious legal action, as stipulated in the agreement. Kindly ensure to send an email containing a tracking number for any shipped items to your official Learnrithm email address.

We wish you all the very best in your future endeavors.

Sincerely,

Peter Chukwumeka Okafor
