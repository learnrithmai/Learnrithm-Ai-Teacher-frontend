"Breaking Barriers: Inclusive Education through Audio and Digital Access," 

Proposal for Inclusive Education through Audio Conversion and Assistive Technology

Proposal Summary

This project, "Breaking Barriers: Inclusive Education through Audio and Digital Access," aims to enhance educational access for blind students in northern Nigeria by converting school learning materials into audio formats and integrating assistive technologies in inclusive classrooms. It will promote digital literacy and inclusive education by enabling blind students to learn alongside sighted students in mainstream settings. The project will address the digital divide by equipping educators with capacity-building tools and training to integrate assistive technologies into their teaching practices. Through strategic partnerships and leveraging digital resources, the project will foster international collaboration and promote global competence in Nigeria's education sector. Over 12 months, we will impact 500 students and 50 educators in Kaduna and Plateau States, targeting two specialist schools for the blind and two inclusive schools with a significant population of visually impaired students.



Problem Statement

In Nigeria, blind students face significant barriers to accessing quality education. Traditional learning materials are often not available in accessible formats, and there is a lack of digital literacy among both students and educators. With Northern Nigeria facing multiple burdens, grappling with low literacy rates, higher incidence of children with impaired vision, out of school children and resource constraints, the absence of audio resources and assistive technologies perpetuates educational inequity, hindering the region and Nigeria’s progress toward global competence and collaboration. Many schools lack resources such as braille textbooks, screen readers, and trained staff to support inclusive education. This has led to poor learning outcomes and limited career prospects for blind students. Addressing this challenge requires a structured approach that incorporates digital literacy, assistive technology, and teacher training to ensure blind students receive equitable education opportunities. This digital divide exacerbates the exclusion of blind students from mainstream education, limiting their opportunities for academic and professional success. The proposed program addresses this critical gap by converting learning materials into accessible formats and promoting digital literacy among blind students and their educators.
